# Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills, projects, and educational background. It is fully responsive, features a clean and modern UI, and reflects my learning journey as a B.Tech Information Technology student with a focus on front-end development.
